title: "List event types"
description: "List distinct event types in the log."
source: strata-core@1.2.0
section: event
---

Lists the distinct event types visible in the selected branch and space in sorted order. The optional timestamp lists the types visible at that commit time.

Paginated responses use opaque cursors. Clients should pass the returned cursor back to the same command shape and must not parse cursor contents.

## Examples

List the distinct event types seen in the log.

### CLI

```console
$ strata event append user.created {"id":1}
$ strata event append user.updated {"id":2}
$ strata event types
```

### Wire

```json
{"event_type":"user.created","payload":{"id":1},"type":"event_append"}
{"event_type":"user.updated","payload":{"id":2},"type":"event_append"}
{"type":"event_list_types"}
```

## Parameters

| Name | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `as_of` | `integer` | no | Read as of a position on the logical commit timeline — the `timestamp` from `history` output, not the `version`, and never a calendar date. To read as of a real time, use `as_of_time` instead. |
| `as_of_time` | `integer` | no | Read as of a real time: a wall-clock instant in microseconds since the Unix epoch (UTC), as reported by `committed_at` on a write ack or on any `history` row. Resolves to the commit at or before that instant, and fails rather than guessing if the instant falls outside the branch's recorded history. Mutually exclusive with `as_of`. |

Plus the optional scope: `branch` and `space` (default to the session branch and the `"default"` space).

## Returns

`Page<String, String>`.
