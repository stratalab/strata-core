title: "Delete vector"
description: "Delete one vector key."
source: strata-core@1.2.1
section: vector
---

Deletes one visible vector entry from a collection. Missing keys are represented as no-op mutation acknowledgements.

Successful mutations return an acknowledgement of the outcome: for a state-changing write, the affected target with the mutation effect and commit facts; for mutations that produce a domain result (such as a branch or a promotion outcome), that result object.

## Examples

Delete one vector.

### CLI

```console
$ strata vector collection create docs 3 --metric cosine
created collection docs (3 dimensions, cosine)
$ strata vector upsert docs a [1.0,0.0,0.0]
created a in docs
$ strata vector delete docs a
deleted a in docs
$ strata vector exists docs a
false
```

### Wire

```json
{"collection":"docs","dimension":3,"metric":"cosine","type":"vector_create_collection"}
{"collection":"docs","key":"a","type":"vector_upsert","vector":[1.0,0.0,0.0]}
{"collection":"docs","key":"a","type":"vector_delete"}
{"collection":"docs","key":"a","type":"vector_exists"}
```

## Parameters

| Name | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `collection` | `string` | yes | Collection name. |
| `key` | `string` | yes | Vector key. |

Plus the optional scope: `branch` and `space` (default to the session branch and the `"default"` space).

## Returns

`MutationAck` — an acknowledgement with no payload.
